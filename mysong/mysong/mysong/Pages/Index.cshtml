            Lately I been, I been losing sleep<br>
            Dreaming about the things that we could be<br>
            But baby I been, I been prayin' hard<br>
            Said no more counting dollars<br>
            We'll be counting stars<br>
            Yeah, we'll be counting stars<br>
            I see this life<br>
            Like a swinging vine<br>
            Swing my heart across the line<br>
            In my faces flashing signs<br>
            Seek it out and ye shall find<br>
            The old, but I'm not that old<br>
            Young, but I'm not that bold<br>
            And I don't think the world is sold<br>
            I'm just doing what we're told<br>
            I, feel something so right<br>
            Doing the wrong thing<br>
            I, feel something so wrong<br>
            But doing the right thing<br>
            I could lie, could lie, could lie<br>
            Everything that kills me makes me feel alive<br>
            Lately I been, I been losing sleep<br>
            Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be<br>
            Baby I been, I been prayin' hard<br>
            Said no more counting dollars<br>
            We'll be counting stars<br>
            Lately I been, I been losing sleep<br>
            Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be<br>
            But baby I been, I been prayin' hard<br>
            Said no more counting dollars<br>
            We'll be, we'll be counting stars<br>
            I feel the love<br>
            And I feel it burn<br>
            Down this river every turn<br>
            Hope is a four letter word<br>
            Make that money<br>
            Watch it burn<br>
            Old, but I'm not that old<br>
            Young, but I'm not that bold<br>
            And I don't think the world is sold<br>
            I'm just doing what we're told<br>
            I, feel something so wrong<br>
            But doing the right thing<br>
            I could lie, could lie, could lie<br>
            Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly<br>
            Lately I been, I been losing sleep<br>
            Dreaming about the things that we could be<br>
            Baby I been, I been prayin' hard<br>

            Said no more counting dollars<br>
            We'll be, we'll be counting stars<br>
            Take that money and watch it burn<br>
            Sink in the river the lessons I learned<br>
            Take that money and watch it burn<br>
            Sink in the river the lessons I learned<br>
            Take that money and watch it burn<br>
